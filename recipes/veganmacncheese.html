        <h4>Description</h4>
           <p>Super creamy vegan macaroni and cheese with minimal time and 
            ingredients required. The trick is to boil the pasta with 
            minimal water so that the starchy pasta water can act as 
            an emulsifier for the cheesy sauce. </p> 
        

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz. elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegan butter</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened plant milk</li>
            <li>8 oz. vegan cheese shreds</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, garlic powder to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil about 2 cups of water in a kettle. Add dried pasta to a saucepan. Cover the pasta in the 
                boiling water (use more or less as needed to just cover it). Throw in a good pinch of salt 
                and then bring the water to a boil. Stir occasionally to keep the pasta 
                from sticking.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, lower the heat and cook until al dente and most of the water 
                has evaporated (about 6 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add in vegan butter and plant milk, stir until melted, and then add in the vegan 
                cheese shreds and stir those until melted. </li>
            <li>Season to taste and serve immediately!</li>
        </ol>
